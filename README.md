# Quick intro and setup instructions
This framework contains a set of reusable rules for OpenHab. It contains the following components:
1. The item definitions and bindings in OpenHab.
2. The [HABApp](https://habapp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) process that communicates with OpenHab via
   the REST API. 
3. This Zone API Python library, integrated with HABapp via a single HABApp rule.

It is a more complicated architecture compared to having everything running within OpenHab process,
but on the other hand, we can use Python 3 libraries. See [here](https://community.openhab.org/t/habapp-vs-jsr223-jython/112914)
for the comparison between HABApp and JSR223 Jython.

## 1. Install the libraries
```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-venv # to install python3-venv library
  python3 -m venv my-home # this will create 'my-home' folder
  cd my-home
  source bin/activate
  python3 -m pip install zone-api # this will install zone-api and its dependencies including HABapp
```

Refer to the instructions on the [official HABApp website](https://habapp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
for additional clarifications.

## 2. Configure HABapp
First run the following commands within the `my-home` folder to start HABapp and to generate the HABapp configuration
files.
```bash
  mkdir habapp
  ./bin/habapp --config habapp/ # HABapp will create the config.yml and logging.yml files.
```

Now that the config files have been created, press Ctrl-C to kill HABapp. We will change the following 4 values in
`config.yml` file to specify the OpenHab server.
```
  host: localhost  # the OpenHab server IP address
  port: 8080                                                                  
  user: ''         # the OpenHab3 username
  password: ''     # the OpenHab3 password
```

Next, add a new logger for Zone API to the file `logging.xml` under the section "**loggers:**".
```
  ZoneApis:                                                                     
    level: INFO                                                                 
    handlers:                                                                   
      - HABApp_default                                                          
    propagate: False 
```

See [the HABApp website](https://habapp.readthedocs.io) for additional detail.

## 3. Create the zone-api configuration file.
Create the file `my-home/habapp/zone-api-config.yml` with the content below:
```yaml
system:
  activity-times:
    wakeup: '6:35 - 9'
    lunch: '12:00 - 13:30'
    quiet: '20:00 - 22:59'
    dinner: '17:50 - 20:00'
    sleep: '23:00 - 7:00'
    auto-arm-stay: '20:00 - 2:00'
    turn-off-plugs: '23:00 - 2:00'

  email-service:
    smtp-server: smtp.gmail.com
    port: 465
    sender-email: sender@gmail.com
    sender-password: password

  alerts:
    email:
      owner-email-addresses:
        - recipient@gmail.com
      admin-email-addresses:
        - recipient@gmail.com

# Contains the parameters for each named actions.
action-parameters:
  AlertOnBadComputerStates:
    maxCpuTemperatureInDegree: 60
```
The latest version of this file can be found [here](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/master/habapp/zone-api-config.yml).

## 4. Create a HABapp rule to integrate with ZoneApi.
Next create the file `configure_zone_manager.py` under `my-home/habapp/rules` (HABapp created this folder earlier). Copy
the following content into that file.
```python
import HABApp
import os
import yaml

from zone_api import zone_parser as zp
from zone_api import platform_encapsulator as pe


class ConfigureZoneManagerRule(HABApp.Rule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        self.run.soon(self.configure_zone_manager)

    # noinspection PyMethodMayBeStatic
    def configure_zone_manager(self):
        config_file = './habapp/zone-api-config.yml'
        if not os.path.exists(config_file):
            raise ValueError("Missing zone-api-config.yml file.")

        pe.log_info(f"Reading zone-api configuration from '{config_file}'")

        with open(config_file, 'r') as file:
            config = yaml.safe_load(file)

        zm = zp.parse(config)
        pe.add_zone_manager_to_context(zm)

        pe.log_info(str(pe.get_zone_manager_from_context()))


ConfigureZoneManagerRule()
```
This is the only rule that is needed to bootstrap the framework. It reads the configuration from the yaml file in the
section above.
The latest version of this file can be found [here](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/master/habapp/rules/configure_zone_manager.py).

## 5. Change OpenHab item names to patterns recognized by the default Zone API parser
Let's adjust the OpenHab items files to something like this:
```
String Zone_Office { level="FF" }
Switch FF_Office_LightSwitch "Office Light"
  { channel="zwave:device:9e4ce05e:node8:switch_binary",                                            
    durationInMinutes="15" }                                                                        
Switch FF_Office_LightSwitch_MotionSensor "Office Motion Sensor"                                    
  { channel="mqtt:topic:myBroker:xiaomiMotionSensors:OfficeMotionSensor"}
```
Zone API groups items into devices and organizes devices into zones. The items above define a zone names `Office` on the
first floor (`FF` abbreviation). The next two items define a [Light](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/master/src/zone_api/core/devices/switch.py)
device and a [MotionSensor](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/master/src/zone_api/core/devices/motion_sensor.py)
in the `Office` zone (via the convention `FF_Office` prefix).

## 6. Start HABapp and observe the action via the log file
Restart HABapp with `./bin/habapp --config habapp/` and then monitor the HABapp activity via `tail -F habapp/log/HABApp.log`.
You should see something like this:
```
[2021-06-20 22:42:06,155] [             HABApp.Rules]     INFO | Added rule "ConfigureZoneManagerRule" from rules/configure_zone_manager.py
Zone: Office, floor: FIRST_FLOOR, internal, 2 devices
  Light: FF_Office_LightSwitch, duration: 15 minutes, illuminance: 8
  MotionSensor: FF_Office_LightSwitch_MotionSensor, battery powered

  Action: MOTION -> TurnOnSwitch
  Action: SWITCH_TURNED_ON -> TurnOffAdjacentZones
```

Based on the zone attributes, and the devices available, certain actions will be enabled. In this case, the action
`TurnOnSwitch` and `TurnOffAdjacentZones` are triggered on the `MOTION` and `SWITCH_TURNED_ON` events. At this point
you have light management including turning on the light when the motion sensor triggers, and a timer to turn off the
light after 15 minutes of idle. You have just re-used a rule!

See [here](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/tree/master/src/zone_api/core/devices) for the full list of supported
devices, and [here](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/tree/master/src/zone_api/core/actions) for the list of built-in
actions.

The rest of this document goes into the rationale and design of the library.

# Zone API - an alternative approach to writing rules
In OpenHab, items are defined in a flat manner in the *.items* files under the */etc/openhab/items folder*.
They are typically linked to a channel exposed by the underlying hardware.
This flat structure has an impact on how rules (whether in Xtend or Jython) are organized. As there
is no higher level abstraction, rules tend to listen to changes from the specific devices. When the
rules need to interact with multiple devices of the same type, they can utilize the 
[group concept](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/items.html#groups). An example of good
usage of group is to turn off all lights. By linking all smart lights to a group switch, turning off
all the lights can be done by changing the state of the group switch to OFF.
                                                                                
What is more tricky is when rules need to interact with different devices within the same area. The
typical solution is to group unrelated items that belong to the same zone either by using a naming
pattern, or by dedicated groups. For example, the light switch and motion sensor in the Foyer area
can be named like this: "FF_Foyer_Light", and "FF_Foyer_MotionSensor". When a sensor is triggered,
the zone can be derived from the name of the triggering item, and other devices/sensors can be
retrieved using that naming convention. This works but as there is not sufficient abstraction, the
rules are highly coupled to the naming pattern.
                                                                                
The [Zone API](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis) provides another approach. It is a layer
above the devices / sensors. Each [ZoneManager](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/master/src/zone_api/core/immutable_zone_manager.py)
(i.e. a house) contains multiple [zones](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/master/src/zone_api/core/zone.py)
(i.e. rooms), and each zone contains multiple [devices](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/tree/master/src/zone_api/core/devices).
Each zone is associated with a set of [actions](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/tree/master/src/zone_api/core/actions) 
that are triggered by certain [events](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/master/src/zone_api/core/zone_event.py).
The usual OpenHab events are routed in this manner:

```
OpenHab events --> ZoneManager --> Zones --> Actions
```

The actions operate on the abstract devices and do not concern about the specific naming of the items or
the underlying hardware. They replace the traditional OpenHab rules. Actions can be unit-tested with
various levels of mocking.

**Most importantly, it enables reusing of action logics.** There is no need to reinvent the wheels for 
common rules such as turning on/off the lights. All ones need to do is to populate the zones and
devices / sensors, and the applicable actions will be added and processed automatically.

ZoneApi comes with a set of built-in [actions](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/tree/master/src/zone_api/core/actions).
There is no need to determine what action to add to a system. Instead, they are added automatically based on the
zones structure and based on the type of devices available in each zone.

Here is a sample info log that illustrate the structure of the managed objects.
```text
Zone: Kitchen, floor: FIRST_FLOOR, internal, displayIcon: kitchen, displayOrder: 3, 7 devices

# Core concepts and API
## ZoneManager
Contains a set of zones and is responsible for dispatching the events to the zones.

## Zone
Contains a set of devices, actions, and is responsible for dispatching the events to the actions.

A zone is aware of its neighbors. Certain rules such as the [turning on/off of the lights](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/master/src/zone_api/core/actions/turn_on_switch.py)
is highly dependent on the layout of the zones. The following [neighbor](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/master/src/zone_api/core/neighbor.py)
types are available.
1. ```CLOSED_SPACE```
2. ```OPEN_SPACE```
3. ```OPEN_SPACE_MASTER```
4. ```OPEN_SPACE_SLAVE```

## Devices
The [devices](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/tree/master/src/zone_api/core/devices)
contains one or more underlying OpenHab items. Rather than operating on a SwitchItem or on a
NumberItem, the device represents meaningful concrete things such as a [MotionSensor](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/master/src/zone_api/core/devices/motion_sensor.py),
or a [Light](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/master/src/zone_api/core/devices/switch.py).
Devices contain both attributes (e.g. 'is the door open') and behaviors (e.g. 'arm the security
system').

## Events
Similar to the abstraction for the devices, the events are also more concrete. Zone API maps the
OpenHab items events to the event enums in [ZoneEvent](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/master/src/zone_api/core/zone_event.py)
such as ```ZoneEvent.HUMIDITY_CHANGED``` or ```ZoneEvent.PARTITION_ARMED_AWAY```.
There is also the special event ```ZoneEvent.TIMER``` that represents triggering from a scheduler.

The event is dispatched to the appropriate zones which then invokes the actions registered for that
event. See [EventInfo](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/master/src/zone_api/core/event_info.py)
for more info.

## Actions
All the [actions](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/tree/master/src/zone_api/core/actions) implement the [Action](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/master/src/zone_api/core/action.py) interface.
The action's life cycle is represented by the three functions: 
1. ```on_startup()``` - invoked after the ZoneManager has been fully populated, via the event
   ```ZoneEvent.STARTUP```.
2. ```on_action()``` - invoked where the device generates an event or when a timer event is
   triggered (via ```ZoneEvent.TIMER```).
3. ```on_destroy()``` - currently not invoked.

The ```@action``` decorator provides execution rules for the action as well as basic validations.
If the condition (based on the execution rules) does not match, the action won't be executed.
Below are the currently supported decorator parameters:
1. *devices* - the list of devices the zone must have in order to invoke the action.
2. *events* - the list of events for which the action will response to.
3. *internal* - if set, this action is only applicable for internal zone
4. *external* - if set, this action is only applicable for external zone
5. *levels* - the zone levels that this action is applicable to. the empty list default value indicates that the action is applicable to all zone levels.
6. *unique_instance* - if set, do not share the same action instance across zones. This is the case when the action is stateful.
7. *zone_name_pattern* - if set, the zone name regular expression that is applicable to this action.
8. *external_events* - the list of events from other zones that this action processes. These events won't be filtered using the same mechanism as the internal events as they come from other zones.
9. *priority* - the action priority with respect to other actions within the same zone. Actions with lower priority values are executed first.

These parameters are also available to the action and can be used as a filtering mechanism
to ensure that the action is only added to the applicable zones. See [ZoneParser::add_actions](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/dc3894780a1715b8845460be87ffff5c0c219afa/src/zone_api/zone_parser.py#L176).

Here is a simple action to disarm the security system when a motion sensor is triggered:

```python
from zone_api import security_manager as sm

The decorator for the action above indicates that it is triggered by the motion event, and should
only be added to a zone that contains both the AlarmPartition and the Motion devices.

Actions can read parameters from the ```zone-api-config.yml``` file (see section 3 above).

## ZoneParser and the default OpenHab item naming conventions
This is the default parser that retrieves items from OpenHab and creates the appropriate zones and 
devices based on specific naming conventions. Note that this is just a default parser, it is 
possible to create zones and devices using a different naming convention, or even manually. The
Zone API is not dependent on any specific naming pattern.

See [sample.items](https://github.com/yfaway/openhab-rules/blob/master/items/) files that is
parsable by ZoneParser.

### OpenHab zone items
The zones are defined as a String items with this pattern Zone_{name}:
```    
String Zone_GreatRoom                                                           
    { level="FF", displayIcon="player", displayOrder="1", openSpaceSlaveNeighbors="FF_Kitchen" } 
```
The levels are the reversed mapping of the enums in Zone::Level.

Here are the list of supported attributes:
* level: reversed mapping of the enums in Zone::Level. 'FF', 'SF', 'TF', 'BM' for first floor,
  second floor, third floor, basement.
* external: 'true' or 'false'
* openSpaceNeighbors: a list of open space adjacent zone ids such as 'FF_Kitchen', where 'FF' is
  the level and 'Kitchen' is the zone name.
* openSpaceMasterNeighbors: a list of adjacent master zone ids. When a master zone's light is
  turned on, all the slave zones' light will be turned off.
* openSpaceSlaveNeighbors: a list of adjacent slave zone ids.
* displayIcon: an OpenHab icon name.
* displayOrder: an integer; the lower the value the higher the order.
       
### OpenHab device items
The individual OpenHab items are named after this convention: ```{zone_id}_{device_type}_{device_name}```.

For the full list of supported devices, see [ZoneParser](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/master/src/zone_api/zone_parser.py#L57).

To see the functions supported by each device, view the [device classes](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/tree/master/src/zone_api/core/devices).

# Common services
## Alert
This is a common service to send various notifications such as security violation or temperature / humidity getting too
high. The actions just need to classify whether an alert is info, warning, or critical. The service will provide
appropriate implementation.

Currently three mechanisms are supported:
1. Email: send an email notification to either the owners or the administrators.
   See [zone-api-config.yml](https://github.com/yfaway/zone-apis/blob/master/habapp/zone-api-config.yml) for more info.

2. Audio: send a text-to-speed (TTS) to one or more connected audio devices. The volume is set based on the criticality
   of the alert.

3. Light: if a critical alert occurs during the night, the internal lights are turned on.
